            <h1>Welcome to Prose</h1>
            <p>Prose is a <em>very</em> simple stylesheet you can use to quickly prepare some text for pretty online display. Prose is elegant, responsive and dead-simple. The document you're viewing right now uses Prose with all the default settings.</p>
            <p>If you'd prefer a more technical explanation, Prose is a very small, easily customizable <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> file, designed to be used in conjunction with <a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">normalize.css</a> to turn some quick HTML markup into a presentable web-page. The only dependency is a container <code>div</code> for a simple responsive design.</p>
            <h2>Example</h2>
            <p>Here's a basic HTML template to get you started using Prose.css:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <pre>
&#x3C;!DOCTYPE HTML&#x3E;
&#x3C;html lang=&#x22;en&#x22;&#x3E;
    &#x3C;head&#x3E;
        &#x3C;title&#x3E;Prose.css&#x3C;/title&#x3E;
        &#x3C;meta http-equiv=&#x22;content-type&#x22; content=&#x22;text/html; charset=utf-8&#x22; /&#x3E;
        &#x3C;meta name=viewport content=&#x22;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&#x22;&#x3E;
        &#x3C;link rel=&#x22;stylesheet&#x22; href=&#x22;css/normalize.css&#x22;&#x3E;
        &#x3C;link rel=&#x22;stylesheet&#x22; href=&#x22;css/prose.css&#x22;&#x3E;
    &#x3C;/head&#x3E;
    &#x3C;body&#x3E;
        &#x3C;div id=&#x22;container&#x22;&#x3E;
            &#x3C;!-- Your markup goes here --&#x3E;
        &#x3C;/div&#x3E;
    &#x3C;/body&#x3E;
&#x3C;/html&#x3E;
                </pre>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Easily customize variables like the text-width, padding, colors, and so on, or don't touch a thing and it will still look great!</p>
            <h2>Styled HTML elements:</h2>
            <p>Here is an unordered list:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This is the first</li>
                <li>The next entry</li>
                <li>The penultimate</li>
                <li>And the last</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And here is an ordered one:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Item the first</li>
                <li>Item the second</li>
                <li>Item the third</li>
                <li>And so on...</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Here is a horizontal rule:</p>
            <hr>
            <p>And here's a bunch of text:</p>
            <p>Those meteorologies are nothing more than anethesiologists. We know that a musician is the jury of a fur. The first sodden geranium is, in its own way, a weight. If this was somewhat unclear, pelicans are bubbly mittens. Though we assume the latter, a confirmation is the sauce of a boot. The snows could be said to resemble weary dances. As far as we can estimate, a motion is a backswept consonant.</p>
            <p>Authors often misinterpret the gender as a hitchy budget, when in actuality it feels more like a dovetailed italian. What we don't know for sure is whether or not their kitten was, in this moment, a comfy Vietnam. The badges could be said to resemble grave saxophones. A nutlike current without babies is truly a ferry of inept step-daughters. We can assume that any instance of a poet can be construed as an unwrung space. Lordly rats show us how stools can be cards. However, the first spineless gender is, in its own way, a helium.</p>
            <p>Plus, why not a block quote?</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>“Some posit the bizarre hyacinth to be less than spheric. A home is a splendid minister. A glummer caterpillar's seal comes with it the thought that the cunning newsprint is a girdle. The streetcar is a mailman.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Or some code:</p>
            <pre>def code(var):
    print("Sweet!")
    return True</pre>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
